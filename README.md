I am looking at generative AI's new methods and seeing if I can implement something cool.  
Basically, how can we develop and utilise the process models?

## Rectified flow
One of my first interests in this area is rectified flow and how to use it in different and interesting ways.
 - RL enhancement with tilting?
 - Density <-> velocity: How can I use this to mix traditional methods and Gen AI

## Diffusion
I want to get the hang of this attempt with SDEs.
 - DDIM
 - DDPM
